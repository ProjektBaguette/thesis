\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The models of the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) have been created for
 developing high quality software.
 However, these models target big-scale software engineering enterprises
 with sophisticated management, specialized resources and an almost infinite
 project budget.
 The implementation of all these models with agile teams, build up with
 allrounder resources, is for small-scaled enterprise economically hard
 or even impossible to bear

.
 Nevertheless, a software product is always bound to certain quality requirement
s, have strict deadlines for certain artifacts and a cap on expenses which
 needs to be complied.
 To reach this goals its indispensable to introduce reasonable SQA models
 for small-scale software engineering enterprises for their software development
 cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this study is the literature research to determine the
 answers to the research questions.
 I am going to select three from all found best practice methods for each
 development cycle.
 The selection of the three methods depends on how appropriate the method
 can be tailored to a small-scaled software company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the selected best practice methods, I am going to create a cost-bene
fit analysis based on the available data found in the literature for the
 researched method or quality assurance task.
 To summarize all found results, i create a catalog consisting of an overview
 of the software process phases with its selected rational Quality & Assurance
 Methods.
 Thereby, i will dispute conclusions found in the results to each method.
 The aim of the research should be, to be able to identify an optimal SQA
 model level and its distribution throughout the project life cycle

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The insights gained through the comparisons of the different SQA Methods
 should help project managers, CIO's and development teams reaching the
 defined quality standards without bloated project budgets, by selecting
 effective methods tailored to the needs and possibilities of the company.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research is separated in two phases, whereas the output of the first
 phase leads to the input of the second phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main question to answer will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Which pragmatic efforts and best practice models in SQA have to get prioritize
 by small-scaled software engineering enterprises

 in the developing process for two selected phases within the product creation
 cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answered the first question, I am going to take the insights of the found
 results as a base for the second question, which will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Which of the found best practices fits best to the relation between costs
 of introducing the test model and the value gained in cost reduction for
 assuring quality of software artifacts, such as requirements, specifications
 and implementation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My expectations to the result of this study are as follows.
 I expect to find some (cheap) to implement SQA Methods for some phases
 in a development process, which although have a big impact on the final
 product quality and project costs.
