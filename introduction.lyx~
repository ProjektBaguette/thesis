\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The models of the Quality Assurance (QA) have been created for developing
 high quality software.
 However, these models target big-scale software engineering enterprises
 with sophisticated management, specialized resources and an almost infinite
 project budget.
 The implementation of all these models with agile teams, build up with
 allrounder resources, is for small-scaled enterprise economically hard
 or even impossible to bear (cf.
 G.
 Hongying.
 Y.
 Cheng, 2011: pp:382-387).
 Nevertheless, a software product is always bound to certain quality requirement
s, have strict deadlines for certain artifacts and a cap on expenses which
 needs to be complied.
 To reach this goals its indispensable to introduce reasonable QA models
 for Small-Scale Software Engineering Enterprises for their software development
 cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Questioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research is separated in two phases, whereas the output of the first
 phase leads to the input of the second phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main question to answer will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Which pragmatic efforts and best practice models in QA have to get prioritize
 by small-scaled software engineering enterprises (cf.
 G.
 Hongying.
 Y.
 Cheng, 2011:pp 382-387) in an agile developing process and for which phases
 defined by RUP to lower the overall costs without bloating up a project
 budget.
 (cf.
 E.
 Shihab, 2011:pp 1106-1109).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answered the first question, I am going to take the insights of the found
 results as a base for the second question, which will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Which of the found best practices fits best to the relation between costs
 of introducing the test model and the value gained in cost reduction for
 assuring quality of software artifacts, such as requirements, specifications,
 designs and code (cf.
 B.
 Nikolik, 2012:pp:1229-1238).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Relevanz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of this study is the literature research to determine the
 answers to the research questions.
 I am going to select two from all found best practice methods for each
 development cycle determined by the Rational Unified Process (RUP).
 The selection of the 2 methods depends on how appropriate the method can
 be tailored to a small-scaled software engineering team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the selected best practice methods, I am going to create a cost-bene
fit analysis based on the available data found in the literature for the
 researched method or quality assurance task.
 To summarize all found detailed results, i create a catalog consisting
 of an overview of the software process development cycles with its selected
 rational Quality & Assurance Methods.
 Thereby, i will dispute conclusions found in the results to each method.
 The aim of the research should be, to be able to identify an optimal QA
 Model level and its distribution throughout the project life cycle.
 (cf.
 T.
 Abdel-Hamid, 1988:pp 394-411).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The insights gained through the comparisons of the different QA Methods
 should help project managers reaching the defined quality standards without
 bloated project budgets, by selecting effective methods tailored to the
 size of his team.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My expectations to the result of this study are as follows: I expect to
 find some cheap to implement QA Methods for some phases in a development
 process, which although have a big impact on the final product quality
 and project costs.
