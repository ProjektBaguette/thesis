@misc{Nikolik2012,
abstract = {Context $\backslash$nSoftware companies invest in quality assurance in order to lower software development and maintenance cost, and to increase revenue and profit margins. To contribute to increase of net income, a quality assurance organization has to consider cost and value of the testware involved in assuring quality of software artifacts, such as requirements, specifications, designs, and code. $\backslash$nObjective $\backslash$nThis paper proposes a set of economic metrics: testware return on investment, inflation, and cost and value sensitivity to artifact changes and time passage. The paper proposes a set of guidelines on lowering testware cost, on increasing value, on maximizing return on investment, and on when to release. $\backslash$nMethod $\backslash$nThis paper presents an industrial case study data on the relation between test case cost and value, and on cost and value sensitivity to time passage and artifact changes. $\backslash$nResults $\backslash$nThe industrial case study showed return on investment on test cases of up to 200\%, deflation of up to âˆ’2\% per month, undesirable economic effects, such as test case cost outpacing test case value and rapid test case value depreciation based on time passage. $\backslash$nConclusion $\backslash$nA viable QA organization should measure and improve test case return on investment, inflation, and cost and value sensitivity to artifact changes and time passage.},
